Test case
- Using HTTP POST create a new resource, read the response and compare the result as expected
- Using HTTP GET, send a request containing the parameters in the URL and verify it compares the result with the expected one.

The tested platform is https://httpbin.org

https://httpbin.org/ip -> Returns the IP address <br />
https://httpbin.org/user-agent -> Returns the user agent.
https://httpbin.org/get -> Returns GET data sent in a URL
